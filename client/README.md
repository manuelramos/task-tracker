## Exercise: Task tracker

Please develop a small SPA with this simple requirements:

    Present visually a list of tasks in 3 different states: Planned, In progress, Completed. DONE
    Each task contains, name, description, estimate and state. DONE
    The user needs to be able to add/remove and change the state of the tasks. DONE 
    Somewhere in the SPA you need to present an up to date status, adding up all hours for each state.  DONE

Notes:

You can assume it's a single user SPA, and there's no need to store data; but the user needs to be able to add/remove and see tasks.  

Mocking a REST api is suggested.

You can reuse any existing library, but please distribute the solution with them.

Write code as you would for production, having in mind that usability is important as well.
